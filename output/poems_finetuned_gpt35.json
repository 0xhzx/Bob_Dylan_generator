the growing of my soul\n\nAll you have to do is dream me up -- that air castle -- lean\n\nYou tell me it's the hardest door you've ever opened\n\nI cried and sighed at you, my burning to see the

that night\n\nIt couldn't be your year, you said half of it wasn't true\n\n\n\nI'm glad not to scratch again and have to scratch again in paradise\n\nGonna eat my pie bad, burn my candle fane, in the girl that durns\n\n\n\nThe first time we met, you put me off by putting on lipstick and this ain't what I was expecting\n\nThe first time I put that blood in your hair, I got a flash back to Central Park\n\nYou made a vow that we had too many children and had to be fat\n\nOr that I wore a silk woven suit made of old molasses and canvas\n\nThat I thought we'd built a bridge too far to be honest\n\n\n\nThat's all I ask of you, Matty Groves, ash on the sofa, ashes in the sink\n\nGo away, you're breaking my song -- strike that obscene!\n\n\n\nI'll give Jesus a nice roll, who's your daddy gonna idolize, you with The Ledge of Love\n\nAh, with the changing of the water, the sun comes through my eyes\n\n\n\nI shouldn't have taught you such a thing can happen, you were sitting by the
