come to the top of yer cup\n\nIf the wind's got you sideways with with one hand holdin' on\n\nAnd the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone\n\nAnd yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it\n\nAnd the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it\n\nAnd yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long\n\nAnd you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong\n\nAnd lonesome comes up as down goes the day\n\nAnd tomorrow's mornin' seems so far away\n\nAnd you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'\n\nAnd yer rope is a-slidin' 'cause yer hands are a-drippin'\n\nAnd yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys\n\nTurn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys\n\nAnd yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'\n\nAnd the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'\n\nAnd the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'\n\nAnd yer whole world's a-slammin' and bangin'\n\nAnd yer minutes of sun turn to hours

sweat\n\nAnd you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yet\n\nAnd yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air\n\nAnd the whole world's a-watchin' with a window peek stare\n\nAnd yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying\n\nAnd yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'\n\nAnd yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet\n\nAnd you need it badly but it lays on

failed in yesterdays rush\n\nWhen you were faked out an' fooled white facing a four flush\n\nAnd all the time you were holdin' three queens\n\nAnd it's makin you mad, it's makin' you mean\n\nLike in the middle of Life magazine\n\nBouncin' around a pinball machine\n\nAnd there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying\n\nThat somebody someplace oughta be hearin'\n\nBut it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head\n\nAnd it bothers you badly when your layin' in bed\n\nAnd no matter how you try you just can't say it\n\nAnd yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it\n\nAnd yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head\n\nAnd yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead\n\nAnd the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth\n\nAnd his jaws start closin with you underneath\n\nAnd yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind\n\nAnd you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign\n\nAnd you say to yourself just what am I doin'\n\nOn this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'\n\nOn this curve I'm hanging\n\nOn this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking\n\nIn this air I'm inhaling\n\nAm I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard\n\nWhy am I walking, where am I running\n\nWhat am I saying, what am I knowing\n\nOn this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'\n\nOn this mandolin I'm strummin', in the song I'm singin'\n\nIn the tune I'm hummin', in the words I'm writin'\n\nIn the words that I'm thinkin'\n\nIn this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinkin'\n\nWho am I helping, what am I breaking\n\nWhat am I giving, what am I taking\n\nBut you try with your whole soul best\n\nNever to think these thoughts and never to let\n\nThem kind of thoughts gain ground\n\nOr make yer heart pound\n\nBut then again you know why they're around\n\nJust waiting for a chance to slip and drop down\n\n\"Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping\n\nAnd you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping\n\nAnd you jump from

number of bets in the book\n\nWill be rollin' long after the bubblegum craze\n\nYou need something to open up a new door\n\nTo show you something you seen before\n\nBut overlooked a hundred times or more\n\nYou need something to open your eyes\n\nYou need something to make it known\n\nThat it's you and no one else that owns\n\nThat spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting\n\nThat

phonies\n\nWho'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny\n\nWho breathe and burp and bend and crack\n\nAnd before you can count from one to ten\n\nDo it all over again but this time behind yer back\n\nMy friend\n\nThe ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl\n\nAnd play games with each other in their sand-box world\n\nAnd you can't find it either in the no-talent fools\n\nThat run around

wagon\n\nJust for a while 'cause they know it's in style\n\nTo get their kicks, get out of it quick\n\nAnd make all kinds of money and chicks\n\nAnd you yell to yourself and you throw down yer
